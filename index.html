    <h3>Crafting</h3>
    <p>I started my crafting journey with embroidery when I was a junior in high school. I then went on to pick up crocheting towards the end of my frist semester of sophomore year of college. I also picked up cross stitch, but that was closer to the beginning of winter break that same semester. In the summer between my sophmore year and junior year, I started learning knitting. For each hobby I picked up, the reasoning behind it was due to me seeing something online and deciding I could do that. </p>
