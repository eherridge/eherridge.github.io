    <h1>Welcome to my JAMstack website</h1>
    <h3>It's super easy</h3>

    <p>This website is built with HTML and deployed using GitHub. I don't know what else to write, but I'm really excited for the upcoming football game this weekend. I'm manifesting us winning again and hopefully keeping up with our win-streak. We're currently 5-0, so fingers crossed.</p>
